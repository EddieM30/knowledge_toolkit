# math_from_scratch

A living Python module for building math intuition and mastery — from precalculus fundamentals to advanced undergraduate computer science topics.  
This project is my personal math lab: a place to implement, test, and truly understand concepts by building them from scratch.

## 🎯 Vision

- **Grow with me:** This repo will expand as I progress, from high school math through a BS in Computer Science and beyond.
- **Hands-on learning:** Every function, structure, and test is written to reinforce understanding and retention.
- **Breadth and depth:** Topics will range from algebra, relations, and functions to calculus, discrete math, linear algebra, probability, and more.

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone <repo-url>
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   ```
3. Install dev dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # or: pip install pytest
   ```

## 🧪 Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

## 📚 Example Usage

```python
from src.algebra.relation import Relation

r = Relation([(1, 2), (2, 3), (1, 2)])
print(r.pairs)   # set of unique pairs
print(r.domain)  # set of unique inputs
print(r.range)   # set of unique outputs
```
