# knowledge_toolkit

An ever growing, living Python module for deeply understanding college-level concepts - starting with mathematics and expanding into computer science, physics, biology and beyond.

Starting with mathematics (precalculus → algebra → calculus → linear algebra → discrete math → probability), this repository will expand to include:

- Computer Science (algorithms, data structures, systems, AI)
- Pysics & Astrophysics
- Cosmology
- Biology & Chemistry
- History, Philosophy, Economics
- ...and whatever else sparks curiosity

Every concept gets implemented from first principles to reinforce intuition and build lasting mastery.

This is my living implementation journal: theorems proven, algorithms built, models simulated — all in code.

## 🎯 Vision

- **Learn by building:** True understanding comes from implementation, not just reading.
- **One toolkit to rule them all:** A unified, evolving codebase that connects idea across disciplines.
- **From scratch, always:** Favor clarity and fidelity to fundamentals over external libraries.
- **Journey over perfection:** Code will be refactored, concepts revisited, understanding deepened - commits tell the story. 

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EddieM30/knowledge_toolkit.git
   cd knowledge_toolkit
   ```
2. Set up a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python -m venv .venv
   # .venv\Scripts\activate  # On Windows
   source .venv/bin/activate # macOS/Linux
   ```
3. Install dev dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # or: pip install pytest
   ```

## 🧪 Running Tests

   ```bash
   pytest
   ```

## 📚 Example Usage

```python
from Math.core.relation import Relation
from Math.core.function import Function

# Example: Building a function from discrete points with an optional lambda rule to evaluate with
f = Function([(x, x**2) for x in range(-5, 6)], Optional(rule=lambda x: x**2))
print(f.domain) # {-5, -4, -3, -2, -1, 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}
print(f.range)  # {0, 1, 4, 9, 16, 25}
print(f(3))     # 9
print(f(-3))    # 9

# Inverse (returns a Relation - may not be a function!)
print(f.inverse.pairs)
```
